# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a completed VBA code loop will scale effectively to larger data sets. The initial Macro met expectations when analyzing 12 different stock tickers for Total Daily Volume for a given year, and the resulting Annual Return value. 
The VBA code loop has been refactored in this project to analyze a greater number of stock tickers for the same values of Total Daily Volume in a given year, and the Annual Return for the same year. Using the same dataset as the initial code loop, our comparison will be made based on code performance with a built-in timer to determine how long each code block takes in order to complete the loops.

# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

# Summary:

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The primary advantage of refactoring code is that the code can be made to run more efficiently. The code may not introduce any new functionality, but refactoring code will allow a faster loop, or a lower memory utilization. This increase in efficiency can be especially important when dealing with larger datasets.
A main disadvantage of refactoring code is that it can be difficult to ensure the code continues to work as intended without introducing errors or inconsistent syntax.

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?




At times in the completion of refactoring the code as instructed, I had encountered several errors and had to debug them before moving on to the next step.
