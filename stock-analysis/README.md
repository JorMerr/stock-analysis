# stock-analysis
# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a completed VBA code loop will scale effectively to larger data sets. The initial Macro met expectations when analyzing 12 different stock tickers for Total Daily Volume for a given year, and the resulting Annual Return value. 
The VBA code loop has been refactored in this project to analyze a greater number of stock tickers for the same values of Total Daily Volume in a given year, and the Annual Return for the same year.

# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
